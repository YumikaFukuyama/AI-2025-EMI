# Week 3 Introduction to Generative AI (GAI) â€“ Foundations, Applications, Prompt Skills 101

## Mission 1 - What Is GAI?

GAI stands for General Artificial Intelligence. 
It refers to an advanced form of artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide variety of tasks, similar to the way human intelligence works. 
Unlike narrow AI (which is designed for specific tasks like facial recognition or language translation), GAI is capable of generalizing knowledge and performing many different tasks without needing to be specifically trained for each one.

The goal of GAI is to create an AI system that has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do, exhibiting cognitive flexibility and creativity. 
It's a step toward what is sometimes called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Currently, AI systems like me (ChatGPT) are narrow AI, meaning we specialize in specific tasks or domains and don't possess general reasoning capabilities. 
GAI, in contrast, would be able to solve a broader range of problems across multiple domains.
